# How I Built and Deployed My AWS-Powered Portfolio Website Using Git, Terraform, and AWS Services

## Introduction
As a cloud engineer, I wanted to showcase my skills and demonstrate how AWS services can work together to create a robust and secure portfolio website. In this project, I outline the steps taken to build and deploy an AWS-hosted portfolio website using Git, Terraform, and a suite of AWS services.

## Step 1: Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- **What I Did**: Used Terraform to define AWS resources as code, ensuring repeatable and consistent deployments.
- **Why**: Terraform allows version control and automates resource provisioning for scalability and efficiency.

---

## Step 2: Static Website Hosting with Amazon S3

- **What I Did**: Hosted static website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) on Amazon S3.
- **How**:
  1. Created an S3 bucket and enabled static website hosting.

## Step 3: Enhancing Performance with CloudFront and Securing with ACM

- **What I Did**: Integrated CloudFront as a CDN and used AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for HTTPS.
- **How**:
  1. Configured CloudFront for global caching and performance.

     <p align="center">

       <em>Figure 3: Configuring CloudFront for Performance</em>
     </p>

  2. Used ACM to provide a free SSL/TLS certificate.

     <p align="center">

       <em>Figure 4: Setting Up SSL/TLS with ACM</em>
     </p>

  3. Updated Route 53 DNS records for seamless domain integration.

     <p align="center">
       <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4517605a-cb69-429b-9685-f4c4cee21f97" alt="Route 53 DNS Configuration" width="70%">
       <em>Figure 5: Route 53 DNS Record Configuration</em>
     </p>

- **Why**: Ensures fast, secure, and globally accessible website.

---

## Step 4: Custom Domain with Route 53

- **What I Did**: Set up a custom domain using Route 53 and routed traffic through CloudFront.
- **How**:
  1. Registered a domain or transferred an existing one.

     <p align="center">
       <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a73aea9e-6649-4b34-bdad-e52657dd8a8d" alt="Domain Registration in Route 53" width="70%">
       <em>Figure 6: Domain Registration in Route 53</em>
     </p>

  2. Created a hosted zone for DNS management.
  3. Configured A records to point to CloudFront distribution.

- **Benefits**: Professional appearance and optimized global performance.

## Step 5: Interactive Contact Page with API Gateway, Lambda, and SES

- **What I Did**: Built a serverless contact form using AWS services.
- **How It Works**:
  - **Workflow**: Form Submission â†’ API Gateway â†’ Lambda â†’ SES â†’ Email.
  - **Components**:
    1. API Gateway: Routes HTTP requests.

       <p align="center">
         <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c973026c-81b2-42e1-91b9-74ee215944e5" alt="API Gateway Configuration" width="70%">
         <em>Figure 7: API Gateway Configuration</em>
       </p>

    2. Lambda: Validates and processes the input.

       <p align="center">
         <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acc203f7-e6c6-4cb5-b9e3-93986a7ee23f" alt="Lambda Configuration" width="70%">
         <em>Figure 8: Lambda Configuration</em>
       </p>

    3. SES: Sends emails to the inbox.
